# Mondtholomew

Mond but I fixed it, for the most part

## Usage

Download and install the newest .rmskin package from [releases](./releases/latest)

Mondtholomew uses [WebNowPlaying](https://github.com/tjhrulz/WebNowPlaying) by default. This lets the player skin read information from your browser with a [browser extension](https://github.com/tjhrulz/WebNowPlaying#extension-links). You can also use the Spotify app but you need to install [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/docs/getting-started) to use it with any Rainmeter skin.

Right click any of the skins other than weather to center them or to open the settings file. When you edit the settings remember to save the file and then `right click > refresh` the skin to see changes.

## Known issues

- No settings skin
