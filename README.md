# Mondtholomew

Mond but it work

## Features

- Includes the [Anurati Free](https://www.behance.net/gallery/33704618/ANURATI-Free-Font) font by default, no need to download it
- Weather that actually works
- Seamless resizing with mousewheel
- Uses WebNowPlaying for browser and Spotify media info
  - Can be switched back to normal NowPlaying for local music players

## Usage

Download and install the newest .rmskin package from [releases](https://github.com/reisir/mondtholomew/releases/latest)

Mondtholomew uses [WebNowPlaying](https://github.com/tjhrulz/WebNowPlaying) by default. This lets the player skin read information from your browser with a [browser extension](https://github.com/tjhrulz/WebNowPlaying#extension-links). You can also use the Spotify app but you need to install [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/docs/getting-started) to use it with any Rainmeter skin.

Right click any of the skins other than weather to center them or to open the settings file. When you edit the settings remember to save the file and then `right click > refresh` the skin to see changes.

## Known issues

- No settings skin
