# MOND

but I fixed it, for the most part

## Usage

Download and install the newest .rmskin package from [releases](./releases/latest)

For weather to work, you need to install jsmorley's [Weather.com skin](https://forum.rainmeter.net/viewtopic.php?f=118&t=34628#p171501). This skin hijacks that skins measures, icons and configuration.

## Known issues

- Player breaks with durations longer than an hour.
- Player `RemoveArtistFromTitle` feature hangs rainmeter with sufficiently long titles. It's turned off by default because of this.
- Weather doesn't load very gracefully
- No settings skin
