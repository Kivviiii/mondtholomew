## TODO:

- [ ] Better SeparatorPattern (Player.ini)
- [ ] Better ft. feat. featuring detection (Player.ini)
- [ ] Maybe figure out why TitleExtraction crashes on NowPlaying
  - It's not because the measure is used by other NowPlaying measures
  - WNP title measure with subtitution doesn't crash when it's empty so it's probably not that either
